# Prime Engine

Prime Engine is an engine developed by Prof. Artem Kovalovs.

I had taken a course on Game Engine Development under Professor Kovalovs in Spring â€˜24.

Prime Engine is written entirely by Professor Kovalovs. 

The assignment for the course involved implementing features into this engine. This repo contains a snippet of some functionalities that I have added to the engine.

# Tribes Networking Model

Professor Kovalovs had implemented the Tribes Networking Model using TCP sockets.
- Here is a brief overview of the Architecture:
    - We have 2 main entities:
        1. Server Network Manager
        2. Client Network Manager
    - A Client starts by sending out a connection request to the server.
    - Once the server receives this request, it does the following:
        1. Creates a new socket for the for the Server instance specific to this client (Each client has a specific socket to communicate with the server.)
        2. Sends an acknowledgement along with the new server port and address to the client.
        3. On receiving this acknowledgement, the client sends a connection message identifying themselves to this newly created socket.
        4. Any communication that takes place between the Main Server and the client is via the Client specific server.
- Here are some of the features that I was able to add to this implementation along with video demos for the same:
    1. [Force Packet Drops & Debug view for these packet drops](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MmkdRtvrvD6OZEOC3hbbKHaS_P9ea8ge/view?usp=drive_link)
    2. [Convert the existing system into using UDP sockets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kXJRcKUOxbuPSgQvSa42X1daKqYEpX7v/view?usp=sharing)
    3. [Implemented a small multiplayer racing game demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dosqXal6ea-Ni7T1OdAolp9c78b5h3VT/view?usp=sharing)
